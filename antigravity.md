# Thoughts on using Antigravity for this project

> First thought when writing this: there must be away to turn of AI-autocompletion for specific files. Having antigravity suggest stuff when I am reviewing it is not a good idea. I am switching to Vim for this particular file.

My main interest in testing Antigravity for this project is finding out if it can actually help me write stuff that I know I can write myself, but in a domain that I am only semi-comfortable. 

## First thoughts while half-way through the project

- It is fairly chatty, and I like that.

## A revelation
I have "written" very little of this code-base. I have resisted the sometimes very strong urge to simply take over. I have landed in acting as a combo of senior developer, architect and product owner. I.e instead of telling Antigravity **what** to do when something does not work I instead ask for debug output or suggest the area where I **think** the solution lies. Antigravity often knows much more about specific frameworks than I do, but it sometime still makes very human mistakes (looking in the wrong place for a solution, missing imports, etc.)

This rasises one very important question: what is my contribution and can I consider myself the author of this project? I clearly did not write most of the code. I **did** steer the entire process, i.e I did not ask Antigravity to "write a nice ssh-to-pod tunnel operator in Python". I know how every part works since I spec:ed it.

## Further evaluation

While I have pointed out when things don't work as expected, I have not done a full review of the actual implmentation. There is simply no point at this stage since Antigravity often changes strategy when faced with new demands. I hope to learn a lot by reviewing the first stable version of Whistler :)
